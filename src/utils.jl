    decode_cfemail(cfemail::AbstractString) -> String

Decodes a Cloudflare-protected email string (`data-cfemail`) back into its original email address.

Cloudflare uses a simple obfuscation technique to hide email addresses in HTML by embedding
them as hexadecimal strings in the `data-cfemail` attribute. This protects them from basic
web scrapers.

The encoding works as follows:
- The first byte (2 hex digits) represents a random "key" byte.
- Each subsequent byte is the result of XOR'ing a character of the email with the key.
- To decode, each byte is XOR'ed again with the key to recover the original character.

# Arguments
- `cfemail::AbstractString`: A hexadecimal string from the `data-cfemail` attribute, e.g.
  `"fd8e898f889e89888f9899d09b8893998ebd9a9893949c91d39e9290d38b9e"`

# Returns
- The decoded email address as a `String`.
